# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

You want to use `.innerHTML` when you want to make changes to static HTML content or you want to make a simple change. You want to use `.createElement` instead when you want to create many elements and want more control over their creation. It works better with dynamic code since you will only be working with a single element and adding it to the html later rather than editing the whole html file itself.
