# Question

What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

`.textContent` will get the content of any and all elements. This will include styling abd scripts. `.innerText` will instead only get the "human-readable" elements. It will actually render styling and scripts and return what was rendered.
