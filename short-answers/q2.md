# Question

Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

HTMLCollections will only include HTML elements. NodeLists will include all nodes (so things like text or comments alongside tags). They are not arrays, and as such do not have access to almost all array methods. NodeList only has access to forEach() and HTMLCollections have access to none.
